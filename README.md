# GitApiWithJS
Refactored my find an open source project app with using Javascript instead of Python. The original project can be found here: https://github.com/Matawhite/first_api.

Known issues:
View doesn't reset correct if you just submit a new query.
if the owner name is blank, app displays undefined for that field.
